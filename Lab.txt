About remote repositories
A remote URL is Git's fancy way of saying "the place where your code is stored." That URL could be your repository on GitHub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server.

You can only push to two types of URL addresses:

An HTTPS URL like https://github.com/user/repo.git
An SSH URL, like git@github.com:user/repo.git
Git associates a remote URL with a name, and your default remote is usually called origin.
